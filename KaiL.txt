Hi everyone. My name is *-StoicVer-Kai.py* 

Three words? Decisive. Flexible. Stoic. 

Favorite hobby? I don't have hobbies. I focus on my work, and I get things done. Overthinking is for weak pansies, and hobbies are for those not dedicated enough to their craft.

I don't particularly care for animals, but if I had to choose, I would choose an eagle. Once they zero in on their target, they execute, finish, and follow through. An excellent example of a creature with strength.
